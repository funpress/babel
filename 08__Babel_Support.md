title: Babel Support
---

Babel has a very large and quickly growing community, as we grow we want to
ensure that people have all the resources they need to be successful. So we
provide a number of different channels for getting support.

Remember that across all of these communities we enforce a
[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
If you break the Code of Conduct, action will be taken. So please read it and
be conscious of it when interacting with others.

We are also looking to grow a self-supporting community, for people who stick
around and support others. If you find someone asking a question you know the
answer to, take a few minutes and help them out. Try your best to be kind and
understanding when doing so.

## Babel Forum

[Discourse](http://www.discourse.org) has provided us with a hosted version of
their forum software for free (and we love them for it!). If forums are your
thing please stop by [discuss.babeljs.io](https://discuss.babeljs.io).

## Babel Chat

Everyone loves [Slack](https://slack.com). If you're looking for immediate
support from the community then come chat with us at
[slack.babeljs.io](https://slack.babeljs.io).

## Babel Issues

Babel uses the awesome issue tracker provided by
[Phabricator](http://phabricator.org) an open source software development
platform that makes GitHub issues a nightmare of the past.

Babel's Phabricator is available at
[phabricator.babeljs.io](https://phabricator.babeljs.io). You can see all the
open and closed issues on
[maniphest](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/maniphest/).

If you want to open a new issue:

- [Search for an existing issue](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/maniphest/query/advanced/)
- [Login](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/auth/start/) or
  [Create an account](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/auth/register/) (You can
  also login using GitHub, Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc.)
- [Create a new bug report](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-2ufzspoyuk4udiwfnzls#R)
  or [request a new feature](https://phabricator.babeljs.io/maniphest/task/create/?projects=PHID-PROJ-dfaevtocl5zgjtstjijd#R)

### Creating an awesome Babel bug report

Babel issues can sometimes be very difficult to debug remotely, so we need all
the help we can get. Spending a few more minutes crafting a really nice bug
report can help get your problem solved significantly faster.

First, try isolating your problem. It's extremely unlikely that every part of
your setup is contributing to the problem. If your problem is a piece of input
code, try deleting as much code as possible that still causes an issue.
